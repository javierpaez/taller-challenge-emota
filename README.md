# Code Challenge: Payment Transaction Dashboard

## Problem Statement:
You are tasked with building a prototype of a payment transaction dashboard using React.js and TypeScript. Your goal is to create a web application that simulates displaying payment transaction data. The application should allow users to view a list of payment transactions and filter transactions by date range. You can use the script  `npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript` to create the base app or you can use any tool like Vite. When you finish the challenge you must create a new commit directly to main branch.

## Requirements:
- Clone this repository, please DO NOT fork it.
- Create a React.js application that displays a list of payment transactions.
- Implement a mock API to simulate fetching payment transaction data. You can use a JavaScript array to store mock data. You should use just a promise to mock the API, DO NOT create any server.
- Display the following information for each payment transaction: Transaction ID, Date, Description, Amount (in USD)
- Add a date range filter to allow users to filter transactions by a specified date range.
- Implement error handling for API requests. If the API request fails, display an error message to the user.
- You will have 30 minutes to complete it since you start coding.

## Recommendation
Focus on the functionality over the Styles or css.

## Bonus Points (Optional):
- Implement pagination to show a limited number of transactions per page.
- Add sorting functionality to allow users to sort transactions by date or amount.
- Create a summary section that displays the total number of transactions and the total transaction amount within the selected date range.
- Implement styles for responsive design.

## Constraints:
- Third-party APIs are not allowed. You must use a mock API for data.
- You can use any libraries or packages you find suitable for this task.
- The application should be designed with best practices for performance, maintainability, and scalability in mind.
- You are NOT able to use any AI tool but if you are able to search any concept of react on internet.
